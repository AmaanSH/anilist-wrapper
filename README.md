## 🛠️ Usage

Learn how to use the AniList TypeScript Wrapper in your TypeScript project.

### Basic Initialization

Import the `Anilist` class from the package:

```
 import { Anilist } from "@tdanks2000/anilist-wrapper";
```

Create an instance of the `Anilist` class. You can optionally provide an access token for authenticated requests:

```
 // For accessing public endpoints
 const anilist = new Anilist();

// For accessing authenticated endpoints (requires an access token)
const anilistWithToken = new Anilist("YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN");
```

### Making API Calls

The `anilist` object provides access to various services, each dedicated to a specific area of the AniList API. Here's a basic example of fetching anime details:

```ts
const data = await anilist.anime.getAnimeById(1);
console.log(data);
```

Refer to the [Functionality](#functionality) section for a list of available services and their purpose. Consult the individual service files or generated documentation for specific methods and parameters.

## 🔑 Authentication

Some features of the AniList API require authentication. To authenticate, you need to obtain an OAuth access token from the AniList website. [Follow their official documentation](https://docs.anilist.co/guide/auth/) for instructions on how to generate an access token.

Once you have your access token, you can provide it when creating an instance of the `Anilist` class:

```
 const anilist = new Anilist("YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN");
```

This will enable you to access authenticated endpoints and perform actions on behalf of a user.

## ⚙️ Functionality

The AniList API Wrapper organizes its functionality into the following services:

### Anime Service

Provides methods for accessing anime-related information, such as:

- Fetching details about a specific anime.
- Retrieving characters and staff associated with an anime.
- Getting recommendations for similar anime.
- Exploring related anime entries.

### Character Service

Allows you to retrieve information about specific anime and manga characters.

### Manga Service

Offers methods for accessing manga-related information, similar to the Anime Service, including details, characters, staff, and recommendations.

### Media Service

Provides general functions for searching and retrieving information about both anime and manga (media). This might include broader search capabilities or combined results.

### MediaList Service

Enables you to manage a user's anime and manga lists, including adding, updating, and retrieving entries. This requires authentication.

### Staff Service

Allows you to retrieve information about staff members involved in the production of anime and manga (e.g., voice actors, directors, writers).

### User Service

Provides access to user profiles, statistics, and their anime and manga lists. Many of these endpoints require authentication.
